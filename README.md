# Chess

A simple chess game and simple opponent AI. The AI features a minimax search (including alpha-beta pruning) and a simple evaluation function to assess ~20,000 positions per second. 
(The game and AI are incomplete, as castling and En passant are not yet implemented). The AI plays at a level around ELO 800-1000.
